_FastWave_ is an opensource software used for seismic wave modeling in complex media with staggered-grid finite difference method on Graphics Processing Units. The aim of this project is initially just for academic use, but now can be used as major forwarding program in reverse-time migration and waveform inversion which need intensive computation.

The project is at its very initial stage, only acoustic wave modeling in 2D complex media is realized at this moment, but it is not hard to extend the algorithm in acoustic media to elastic or viscoelastic media.

New features, such as multi-GPUs support on single or multi-PC or cluster, will be added in future.
